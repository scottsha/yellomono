# The Yellow Pince-nez

The Yellow Pince-nez is the sequel to the [Yellow Monocle Puzzle](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/the-hivemind "Yellow Monocle Puzzle"), which may be found in the [Halls of Origination](https://www.wowhead.com/halls-of-origination).

The goal of the puzzle is to eliminate all but one color on a board using toggles to change square colors. The puzzles may be solved using linear algebra with a finite abelian group.
